# thisfrontenddev.com

A simple website that'll serve as a blog as well as an entrypoint for my potential prospects as a freelance Frontend Engineer.

My services include freelancing as a developer to create or update projects, but also, but not limited to, consulting on front-end topics, mostly on Next.js.

I also have experience doing UI/UX work, and can provide UI/UX services with projects such as wireframing, webdesign, prototyping, and design systems.

## Getting started

Launch the project by cloning this repo, and use these commands in order to get it running on `http://localhost:3000`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
